# Supply-Chain-Shipment-Pricing-Prediction-for-HIV-AIDS-Commodities
Machine learning project analyzing global HIV/AIDS shipment data (10K records, 43 countries) to predict freight costs. Includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and modeling. Random Forest achieved R²=0.70, providing insights for cost optimization and supply chain efficiency.
This project analyzes and predicts shipment costs for HIV/AIDS commodities using machine learning. 
We processed a dataset of 10,000 records across 43 countries and 37 manufacturing sites, 
sourced from Data.gov. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
feature engineering, and model building with Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

Key Highlights:
- Data preprocessing with missing value imputation and one-hot encoding
- Exploratory insights on shipment modes, product groups, and cost drivers
- Machine learning models for freight cost prediction
- Random Forest achieved R² = 0.70, outperforming Linear Regression

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Matplotlib
